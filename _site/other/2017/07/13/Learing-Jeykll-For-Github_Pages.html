<h2>Learning Jekyll For Github Pages</h2>


<p>Welcome
This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll. We’ll cover topics such as getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content, customizing the way your site works and looks, deploying to various environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future development of Jekyll itself.</p>

<p>So what is Jekyll, exactly?Permalink</p>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.</p>

<p>Helpful HintsPermalink</p>

<p>Throughout this guide there are a number of small-but-handy pieces of information that can make using Jekyll easier, more interesting, and less hazardous. Here’s what to look out for.
Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language to process templates. All of the standard Liquid tags and filters are supported. Jekyll even adds a few handy filters and tags of its own to make common tasks easier.</p>
